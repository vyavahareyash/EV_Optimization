1.	Predicting the demand for 2019 & 2020:
For this we used the Polynomial Regression model form the Scikit learn library.
We trained the model using the demand values for 2010-2018 and predicted the values for 2019-2020.

2.	Creating the distance matrix:
We took the demand point coordinates and supply point coordinates from the dataset and calculated the Euclidean distance and arranged the values in the form of a matrix.

3.	Minimizing the cost equation:
We used the PuLP library for optimization. Created the PuLP optimization model.
We declared the DS value as X variable, SCS as S variable and FCS as F variable and defined the cost equation given in the problem statement.
Then defined the constraints from the problem statement in the model and minimized the cost equation. After optimization we get the optimal values for all the variables.

4.	Arranging the values according to the required format:
The variables obtained from the optimization model are arranged in the CSV file according to the submission format using Microsoft Excel.
